# -K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Classification-
This project demonstrates K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification using the Iris dataset. Two features—sepal length and sepal width—were selected along with two classes: Setosa and Versicolor. The dataset was visualized using a scatter plot to observe class separation. A KNN classifier was implemented, and different values of k were manually tested. Decision boundaries were plotted to analyze how changes in k and distance metrics influence the classification results.
