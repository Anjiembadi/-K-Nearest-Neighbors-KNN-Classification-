# -K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Classification-
We loaded the Iris dataset and selected two features (sepal length and sepal width) and two classes (Setosa and Versicolor). The data was visualized using a scatter plot. A KNN model was trained by manually changing k values, and decision boundaries were plotted to understand how k and distance metrics affect classification.
